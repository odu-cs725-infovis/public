# Suggested Papers

This is a list of suggested papers from IEEE VIS 2019-2021, along with a couple older papers. All of these can be accessed through IEEE Xplore via ODU. If you are interested in a paper not on this list, contact me for approval first. Your paper must be selected by **Tues, Feb 15** *before class*.

Suggestion: From just the titles, select 5 papers to download and perform Keshav's 1st pass on.  This will help you to determine an appropriate paper.  If you don't find one that you're interested in from those 5, try another 5, but you don't need to read all of the papers before selecting one.
